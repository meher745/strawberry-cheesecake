Step 1: Make The Graham Cracker Crust

Combine cream cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Press the crumb mixture in the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake in a 350°F oven for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.

Step 2: Make The Creamy Cheesecake Filling

Beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Beat in the sugar, sour cream, salt, and vanilla until well combined. Gently stir in lightly beaten eggs until well combined.
Pour the filling over the prepared crust and set inside a water bath. Bake in a 300°F oven for 1 hour then turn the oven off and let the cheesecake sit in the oven for another hour with the door closed.
Remove the cheesecake from the oven and set it on a wire rack to cool completely.

Step 3: Make The Strawberry Topping

Puree fresh strawberries with cornstarch. Add puree and sugar to a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat until thickened. This may take anywhere between 10 to 20 minutes.
Once thickened, stir in chopped strawberries and set aside to cool. Top the cheesecake with the strawberry sauce and refrigerate for at least 4 hours but overnight is best.
